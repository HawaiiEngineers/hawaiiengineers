A common misunderstanding is that in order to work in the technology field, you have to be really good at programming. There are actually a lot of different things you can do that relate to technology. What's important is figuring out what you are good at and then finding the right place for you to do it. You can do it anywhere, even at a technology company. Just decide where you see yourself and keep going for it, even when you fail. All it takes is one success for you to realize that you can do whatever you set your heart on.
