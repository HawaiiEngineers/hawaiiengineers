*“having the liberty to do whatever I want is the absolute best part of being an engineer.”*

“I don't write software because I want to strike it rich and make millions of dollars (although that would be sweet). I code because I literally write something that hasn't ever existed. Everyday I think of ways of build something from nothing. I've been doing this for almost 10 years and I feel as if I've never worked a day in my life. Money, perks, everyone trying to hire you is nice, however having the liberty to do whatever I want is the absolute best part of being an engineer.”
