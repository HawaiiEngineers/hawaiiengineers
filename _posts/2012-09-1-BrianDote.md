"Develop a wide gamut of skills. Be multi-dimensional. Your life is a diverse set of experiences. Each experience is like a tool in your toolbox, a dot that needs connecting. These are unique to you. Learn to leverage them. Combine them. Extend them. No one else has the same set and therefore, no one else has the exact same lens/perspective. Innovative solutions are hidden in the spaces between. If you always start from compassion and empathy for your end user, you will never go wrong. Learn to listen. Learn to collaborate. True success comes from both."
