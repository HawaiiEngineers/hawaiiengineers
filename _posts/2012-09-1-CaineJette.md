*“huge demand, great pay and benefits, and a real sense of worth”*

“Engineering isn't the easiest major (by a long shot!), but you're literally helping build the future, be it roads, cities, toys, or software. Sticking through the tough parts in school puts you in a great position for the future: huge demand, great pay and benefits, and a real sense of worth. I switched into computer science my junior year of college, so it's never too late!”
