*“Engineering isn't always about crazy math problems and serious stuff; I have a lot of fun at work every day.”*

“As a kid, I really enjoyed puzzles and I spent a lot of time doodling. Now that I'm grown up, I get to use my problem solving skills, creativity, and imagination every day at work. Engineering isn't always about crazy math problems and serious stuff; I have a lot of fun at work every day. Besides being fun, my job is really fulfilling. The projects that I work on have a direct impact on a lot of people, and it's good to know that I'm changing their lives for the better."
