*â€œBesides, Tony Stark was an engineer... And so should you!"*

"We are turning the stuff of dreams into reality. I'm an engineer because I wanted to help people by building new technology that's practical. With a degree in engineering, you can work in pretty much any sector you want . Plus, the pay is good enough to allow you to pursue your non-work passions, whatever they may be...  Besides, Tony Stark was an engineer... And so should you!"
