“There are never enough good engineers to fill all the positions available. Not locally, not on the mainland, and not even internationally. Companies like Ikayzo and Contix fight for the top students in every graduating class, and we strongly favor local applicants. If you study software and contribute to open source projects you will have your pick of companies and locations.”
