I started off college as a pre-med major, but switched my major to computer science during my sophomore year because I enjoyed the introductory CS course at my school so much. My favorite thing about this field is that with hard work and determination you can pretty much make anything you want. One of the biggest things I have taken away from the computer science courses is the ability to approach many different types of problems and to come up with efficient solutions. Technology is becoming a bigger part of our lives and by becoming a software engineer you can help to design the technology that will have a positive impact on our future.
