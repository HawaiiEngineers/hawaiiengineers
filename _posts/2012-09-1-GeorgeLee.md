“Programming is awesome but it's certainly not easy in the beginning. Find friends that are also interested and learn together. Help each other out and don't let your friends get discouraged. Together you'll figure it out and learn much faster than you would by yourself. It's difficult but not insurmountable if you work together. Even now I'll bounce ideas off friends and work with them to figure out problems.
Also, if you have an idea, try and build it! Building something for yourself right now is far more motivating than just wanting to learn it because you may make a lot of money in the future."
