*“Why not you”*

“I went the non-traditional route. I joined the US Air Force after high school to pay for college. The Air Force got me me started the IT field and with the help of great mentors I was able to self study and land a job as a network engineer. I love the life of a techy. If i can do it, you can do it. Why not you.”
