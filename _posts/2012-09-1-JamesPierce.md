"Be the disruptor, not the disrupted"Information Technology allows for the betterment of society when ethically applied.  My advice to all students going into the field is to embrace change and get ready for a journey of life long learning.  It is exciting to be able to realize the "art of the possible" by utilizing emerging technology.  Entire industries have sprung up overnight as a result of technological advances.  Another piece of advice is to find a group of mentors and work with them.  I have had mentors help me personally & professionally throughout my life and career.  Finally, always take time to give back to your community.  This doesn't always mean writing big checks.  Donate your time and skills to causes you are passionate about and make the world a better place.
