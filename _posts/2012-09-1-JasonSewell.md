Tech has been a great enabler for me brining opportunities in life that I never thought I would have had as my younger self. It was kind of a redeeming force in my life at a time when I needed it and it continues to put me in amazing situations I never thought I would be in. You gotta work for it though, it's not a given.

I now own two companies and ultimately do what I want to do every day, know amazing people all over the world, and am continuously energized about all of the things that there is still to learn in my field after 15 years, and think there is still a lot more good that can be applied to the world around us through technology. 

To me it's not a job, it's a lifestyle and part of who I am, and I'm proud I can say that.
