*“Be the engineer that makes life easier.”* 

* Going to a mainland college was a crazy idea in my low income town...SO I made it my first choice
* Money was non-existent...SO I applied for 10+ loans and worked 2 jobs while being a full time student
* I was asked to move back to Hawaii after getting my Bachelors in Computer Systems...SO I stayed and worked at IBM Global for 4 years
* Engineering for women was the road less traveled...SO I got my Masters in Systems Engineering
* Society says that kids should not learn advanced Computer Science and Engineering until the 6th grade...SO I started NanoByteLabs where they start from the age of 5
* THRIVE in challenge...BE afraid of nothing...SO that you can change the world
