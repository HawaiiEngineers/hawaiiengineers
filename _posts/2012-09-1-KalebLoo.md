*â€œEngineers are problem solvers and the world needs more problem solvers."*

"In the field of Engineering, you are challenged by problems that often no one else has solved before.  You get to take part in developing a solution that can impact the lives of millions of people.  The reason I became an Engineer was to do just that--and the greatest thing is, there are many opportunities available and paths to take to achieve this goal.  Engineering is involved in every industry from technology to chemistry to education to business.  As an Engineer, you have the chance to be involved in fixing the issues that you care about with the knowledge that you obtain.  Engineers are problem solvers and the world needs more problem solvers."
