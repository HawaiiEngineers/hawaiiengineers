“Being an engineer allows you to put your science and creativity together into one place. For sure I would not say that it is an easy job, but it is definitely one of the more rewarding jobs. For every problem that you solved at your job, whether you are a civil engineer, nuclear engineer, software engineer, or any other engineers, you are introducing new impact to our everyday life. You can proudly tell the world that you are a part of the solution for this particular problem.

In order to take on such a fun job, keep learning. Embrace the opportunities that are presented in front of you. Be observant with the problems happening next to you and think limitlessly. You will never know if your solution will be next “big thing”.”
