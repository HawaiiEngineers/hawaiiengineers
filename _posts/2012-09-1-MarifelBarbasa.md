*“When starting out, don't be afraid to fail.  It's normal to fail at first.  Fail enough times so you can shoot for the stars later."*

"Developing software is what I do, and at its core is learning.  Learning how to code in a new programming language.  Learning how to use a new tool.  Learning how to utilize these tools together to solve a particular problem.  A software developer, like a craftsman, must know his tools, and every tool takes some amount of time to learn.  So when starting out on learning something new, take things one step at a time and if distracted, try to jump right back on track.  Don't just read how-to articles or follow tutorials.  Go and create something of your own, even if you find that it’s not the best design, not the best tool for the job, or not adhering to best practices.  When starting out, don't be afraid to fail.  It's normal to fail at first.  Fail enough times so you can shoot for the stars later."
