There are two things that I have learned over the years that will open more doors than you can walk through:

First, the best way to learn about something is to try to build it yourself.  Going through the creation process gives you more insight about the subject than spending time analyzing it from the outside.  You can share your knowledge with others based on your own building experience and better relate to engineers at all levels.

Second, more good things happen when you say “yes” versus saying “no”.  Many times, a knee-jerk reaction to a proposal is to say “no” because it is unfamiliar to you, it involves moving to the mainland or you are not confident in your own abilities.  If you are transparent and honest with others (and yourself) about who you are, what you like to do, and what you can do, then there is no reason to say “no” to a proposal from someone who offers you something based on that (provided it is not illegal or unethical).  What ends up happening is you grow as a professional, learn new skills, and that one opportunity leads to another.
