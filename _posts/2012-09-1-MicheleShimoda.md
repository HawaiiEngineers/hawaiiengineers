*“even Disneyland would never have been possible without engineers!  So never stop being curious,  never stop asking questions, never stop looking for a better way”*

“Being an engineer, at its core, is understanding the way all the small details that we take for granted in life work.  Turning on a TV, using a microwave, searching something on Google - people do these things every day, but never give a second thought to the intricate workings that are going on behind it all.  If you've ever thought to yourself, "wouldn't it be great if this thing could have this function?", engineering gives you the power to create that solution.  If you have a passion for learning, creating, doing, innovating - there is nothing you will enjoy more.  And when you enjoy what you do, you will never work a day in your life.  Sure, it's tough.   I've never met a single person who has said it was easy.  But with the knowledge that comes with it, the possibilities become endless.  Think of all the things you could do -- even Disneyland would never have been possible without engineers!  So never stop being curious,  never stop asking questions, never stop looking for a better way, and of course, never think you know better than everyone else. ”
