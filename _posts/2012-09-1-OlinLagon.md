I was raised in public housing in Hawaii so it took some time to feel confident enough that Fortune 500 companies and institutions like MIT's Digital Media Lab were really interested in buying stuff that I created. I was lucky that I had mentors who helped re-build my self confidence. Absolutely everyone has gifts to share!
