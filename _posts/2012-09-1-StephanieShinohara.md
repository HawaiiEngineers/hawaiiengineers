*“Being an engineer is not just rocket science, it's developing innovative technologies that are much cooler.”*

“Engineering to me is all about puzzles and how we, as engineers, figure out how to solve the puzzles that are placed in front of us.  I never knew in high school what I wanted to do with my life, but I loved math and most of the sciences.  I began at USC as an "undeclared" engineer and through a few entry-level courses found my passion in Electrical Engineering.  Being an engineer is not just rocket science, it's developing innovative technologies that are much cooler.”
