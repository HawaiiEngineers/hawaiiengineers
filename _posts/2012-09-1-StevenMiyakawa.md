*“I work as a Full Stack Web Developer for a startup called Mapistry in Oakland, CA. Best job I've ever had.”*

“I was born and raised in Kaneohe, HI. I went to Castle High School and then continued my education at UH Manoa where I received a BS degree in Information and Computer Science. I ended up in a business career. Over the years I had a desire to get back into coding. One day I stumbled across an article about a coding bootcamp called Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. I immediately knew that was my ticket back into the game. Long story short, I attended Dev Bootcamp in the spring of 2013 and had an amazing experience. In the span of 9 weeks, I changed the course of my life. Now I work as a Full Stack Web Developer for a startup called Mapistry in Oakland, CA. Best job I've ever had.”
