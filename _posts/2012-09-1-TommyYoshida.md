*“ I was passionate about what I did and it showed in my work and in my grades.”*

“I went to the University of Hawaii and got a Finance degree. After working for a couple years I realized I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. I went to HCC for the CENT program and finally found my passion for network engineering. I got hooked up with the HCC internship program they had and from there it brought me all the way to my current position as a network engineer at Microsoft. I dunno if my journey is a good example, but a couple things I learned. If you're not passionate about a major, then you will waste your time like I did. The second time around I went to school, I was passionate about what I did and it showed in my work and in my grades.”
