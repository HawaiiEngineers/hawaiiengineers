*"I know itâ€™s only going to get better"*

"Maybe you're like me and all you wanted to do was create something new. I got lucky. Being part of the technology industry gives me the opportunity to wake up everyday and think of new things to build and learn new ways of building them. With the tech tools, platforms, and resources available today it's unbelievable what you can create. After you learn a few rules about what the pieces do and how they fit together, it's really feels like being in the biggest toy store in the world. I can't wait to see what's in store for tomorrow because I know it's only going to get better."
