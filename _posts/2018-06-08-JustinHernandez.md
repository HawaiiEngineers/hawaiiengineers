I love Hawaii. 

I am so proud to have been born and raised in Hawaii; from an early age we are taught the value community and how to live and work together. Good tech is invisible and should enrich people's lives. I strongly feel that tech is about people - whether they be end users or co-workers.Having that focus has enabled me to work on amazing teams, doing everything from: coding, community outreach, writing documentation - whatever the team needs to work through bottlenecks. 

There is code being written today that will affecting and will continue to affect the lives of people for generations. We have a weighty responsibility as tech literate people to ensure that this new generation tech is tempered with empathy.
