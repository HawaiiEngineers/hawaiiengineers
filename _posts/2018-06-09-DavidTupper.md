I started college without any formal coding experience; it was tough. However, the steep learning curve I faced taught me to rise to the challenge. These sort of challenges present themselves often (see debugging). Engineers need to remain flexible and open to learning new ideas. Part of that is realizing that you won't always be the best in your field. One of the challenges I've faced at USC is being surrounded by individuals who know more than me, who have more experience. You have to realize there will always be people like this. Despite that, if you work hard and dedicate yourself to your craft, you will be successful no matter what. You can do it, go win the day.
