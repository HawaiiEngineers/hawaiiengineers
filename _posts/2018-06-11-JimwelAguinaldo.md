"Started college as a computer science major and fell in love with coding after my first CS class. I had no coding experience prior to entering college which made the experience a lot more fun. And no, it's not just typing 1's and 0's. In computer science, you'll find that there is a lot of problem solving but that's the best part. You'll be able to build anything you want with just your computer. If I can do it, you can do it. Trust me, I'm not that smart :)"
