"I discovered coding in my junior year of high school where I learned basic front-end web languages and later in my senior year, back-end/serverless development. What really captivated me about coding was the technical challenges that really forced me to think both logically and outside of the box. Many people believe coding is something very difficult to learn and only for those who start at a young age, however as with anything, there is a learning curve; once you get down your first few programming languages, it becomes easier to grasp and read technical documents. As long as you pursue coding with passion and an open mind you can easily become a well-valued programmer: You don't need to wait till college to discover your passion now and jump ahead of the game in changing the world. Above all, take every opportunity thrown at you in life because one opportunity can always lead to bigger possibilities."
