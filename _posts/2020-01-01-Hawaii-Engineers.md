The purpose of this list is to show our local students the faces of Hawaii born engineers or engineers doing work in Hawaii. The goal is to inspire them to go for an engineering degree.

If you want to help out send us your advice to the students, what high school, college, and where you work to hawaiiengineers at gmail dot com. Or by doing it via code https://github.com/HawaiiEngineers/hawaiiengineers
